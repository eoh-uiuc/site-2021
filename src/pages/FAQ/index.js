                        <h4>When is Engineering Open House for 2021?</h4>
                        <p>Engineering Open House will be on March 26-27, 2021.</p>

                        <h4>How will I be able to see the exhibits?</h4>
                        <p>As of now, all exhibits will be presented on the EOH website either as a prerecorded video or livestream.</p>

                        <h4>What types of exhibits will be presented this year?</h4>
                        <p>We expect there to be exhibits from a majority of our engineering departments. We aim to make the presentation of these as interactive and engaging as possible in the virtual format. Expect pre recorded videos, diy tutorials for at home activities, live streams, and live Q+As.</p>

                        <h4>How will exhibit judging work this year?</h4>
                        <p>We will still be judging exhibits this year, though there will be fewer judging categories and awards compared to previous years. Pre-recorded exhibits may be privately sent out to judges a few days prior to EOH weekend so that judges will have enough time to view them.</p>

                        <h4>Will I be able to go on a campus tour?</h4>
                        <p>There will be opportunities for virtual tours. More information coming about additional informational sessions soon.</p>

                        <h4>Will there be a High school and Middle school design competition?</h4>
                        <p>We plan on posting DIY tutorials aimed for these students during EOH 2021. More information about this coming soon!</p>

                        <h4>Will there be a Midwest Robotics Design Competition?</h4>
                        <p>As of now, we do not expect there to be MRDC this year.</p>

                        <h4>Wil there be a Tesla Coil Concert?</h4>
                        <p>More information about this coming soon! We are hoping to have a socially distant event, following a drive-in concert format this year.</p>

                        <h4>Will there be Robobrawl?</h4>
                        <p>Unfortunately, we do not expect there to be Robobrawl this year.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Will there be any keynote speakers this year?</h4>
                        <p>Yes, we expect there to be a keynote speaker as well as several panels! More information about this coming soon!</p>
